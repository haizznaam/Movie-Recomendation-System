# Movie Recommendation System 

## This is the final project for Data Mining and Advanced Statistical Methods in Business Applications Course

In this project, we aims to develop a movie recommendation system that leverages multiple recommendation techniques and a matrix factorization approach to address data sparsity. The project utilizes data from The-Movie-Dataset, a comprehensive resource for movie information.

### Approaches:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**: This approach recommends movies similar to those a user has enjoyed in the past. Movie attributes such as genre, director, actors, and keywords will be used to identify similar movies.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**: This approach identifies users with similar taste profiles and recommends movies enjoyed by those users. The system will analyze user-movie interaction data to find these patterns.

3. **Hybrid Filtering**: This approach combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to leverage the strengths of both methods. It aims to provide more robust and personalized recommendations.
